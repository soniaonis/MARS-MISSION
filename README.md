# MARS-MISSION
*During a manned mission to Mars, astronaut Mark Watney is left for dead after a terrible storm and abandoned by the crew, who set course back to Earth. But Watney has survived and finds himself trapped and alone on the hostile red planet. With supplies running low, he must rely on his wits and survival instincts to find a way to communicate to Earth that he is still alive.

Dear Candidate,
We need your help to re-equip Watney's computer with basic operations so that he can make energy or supply calculations.

#### Mission requirements

So we need to build a calculator with the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Watney should have the ability to do a single operation or to do several operations in a chain.

Luckily, the computer's browser is working and for the graphical representation of the calculator we can create an application in Vue where Watney would enter the numbers by clicking on buttons representing the digits from 0 to 9, the symbols of the operations and the "=" button to display the result.

We also have available a web server where we could deploy a REST API developed in Spring Boot to implement the calculation logic, creating an endpoint that receives a JSON object with the values of the operands, the operator and returns a JSON object with the status and the value of the calculation result.

Ideally, the provided solution should be easily extendable to more operations, so that in the future Watney could add new operands and perform more sophisticated calculations.

Additionally, we should present a couple of test cases so that Watney can be sure that the operation is correct before deploying it.

#### Delivery instructions

This assignment is of great importance to Watney and therefore we expect your response within 24 hours. In order to make the code available to Watney, please compress all source files into a **compressed file** and send it back by email.
We trust that with your knowledge Watney will soon be able to start his calculations and communicate with the Earth.
